# cli-currency-converter
A CLI currency converter. This is the first project that uses an API (https://www.amdoren.com/currency-api/).
## Purpose of the Project
This will be my first time making use of an API in my code and is a fairly simple project to start with.
## The API - Amdoren
I will be using the Amdoren API (https://www.amdoren.com/currency-api/) for this project as it is free to use. I found this API by using https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis which has a massive collection of free APIs to use. Amdoren has over 150+ currencies and also offers many other APIs for things such as the weather and time zones, which could be useful for future projects.
