# cli-currency-converter
A CLI currency converter. This is the first project that uses an API (https://currencyfreaks.com/).
## Purpose of the Project
This will be my first time making use of an API in my code and is a fairly simple project to start with.
## The API - CurrenyFreaks
I will be using the CurrencyFreaks API (https://currencyfreaks.com/) for this project as it has a free plan which allows you to make 1000 requests a month. I found this API by using https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis which has a massive collection of free APIs to use.
